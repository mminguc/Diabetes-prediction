# Diabetes-prediction

This study aimed at developing a simple and accessible prediction model for high-risk
diabetes that could assist with decreasing the prevalence of diabetes. The National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were used to predict the onset of
adult diabetes. Machine learning models were developed to identify the population most
at risk as well as label important risk factors associated with pre-diabetes and
undiagnosed diabetes compared with the traditional diagnosed diabetes within the adult
population. This project will help decrease the prevalence of diabetes through early
identification and subsequent interventions.
